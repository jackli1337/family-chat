What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
    Monk is used for simplifying MongoDB function syntax for easier use of database functions. It solves the problem
    of us having to use a more difficult syntax that's native to MongoDB.

How does this technology accomplish what it does?
    Below are links to the exact place which shows how monk's functions work to accomplish what it does for us.
    Drop feature helped us remove a collection in our MongoDB completely. Insert feature helped us insert entities
    of a collection easily. Find feature easily finds a field in the database collection for us given the constraints
    we provide.

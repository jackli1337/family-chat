What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
    Archiver is used for file and directory compression. It provides us a way to compact multiple files into one
    so that it can be easily transferred across the internet. This allows users to download files from their family page.

How does this technology accomplish what it does?
    Start by specifying the compression type and depth of compression. For our use case, there is a specific function 
    that allows us to input a specific directory. After doing so, the files within the directory are each added to 
    the archiver. The final destination of the output stream is specified and the archiver closes the output stream as 
    soon as the writeout is complete. We used a promise to wait for the writeout to be completed, then we allow the user 
    to download the directory that was just compressed.

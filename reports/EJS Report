What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
    EJS was used for rendering the pages of this application and setting up templates (partials)

How does this technology accomplish what it does?
    EJS looks for <% and %> syntax in our HTML code so it knows where to use EJS functions
        Looking for <% %>: https://github.com/tj/ejs/blob/259aa234e43fcd19e4038cd87c8f259c92f2583a/ejs.js#L159

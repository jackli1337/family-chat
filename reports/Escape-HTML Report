What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
    This technology will help us patch up HTML/JS injection attacks on our application.

How does this technology accomplish what it does?
    Escape-HTML helps us prevent HTML/JS injections by replacing symbols with their equivalent entities. The code
    basically looks for certain characters that came from user input sources and replaces them with their entity
    equivalents.

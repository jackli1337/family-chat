What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
    MongoDB was used for the database of our application. It provided us a way to store information that the user
    uploads in a structure that is well organized. We also used it to store the temporary user's ID, FirstName,
    LastName, FamilyID for Phase 2.

How does this technology accomplish what it does?
    We didn't use much of this technology since it was mostly handled by the Monk module we used. But I will list the
    links of the equivalent functions that Monk simplified for us.

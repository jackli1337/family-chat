What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?
    Express was used in order to serve static page files for phase one of our project.

How does this technology accomplish what it does?
    First we use the express() function to create a new Express application
        This code can be found here...
        Creating App: https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/c0136d8b48dd3526c58b2ad8666fb4b12b55116c/lib/express.js#L37
    When a client requests for a specific route in our server, express will be able to handle that
    using the get function and receive the client's request. It will then parse the headers and it will then
    send a response back to the client using the sendFile function with the file's name as the parameter.
